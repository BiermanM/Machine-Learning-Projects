# Project 1 Instructions

* Select 2 data sets for the project. One data set should be suitable for regression and the other for classification.

* For each data set:
    *	Decide which column is the target: what you want to learn. 
    *	Use at least 5 R functions for examining each data set (`head`, `summary`, `names`, `cor`, `str`, etc.)

*	Produce at least 2 informative graphs for each data set. 

*	Run at least 2 ML algorithms on each data set, using at least 3 algorithms in all.
    *	Run `summary()` on each model.
    *	Select an appropriate metric to evaluate how well each algorithm performed on the test set.  Provide some commentary and analysis of which algorithm did best and why you think that is the case.
    *	Algorithms we have learned so far:
        *	Regression: linear regression
        *	Classification: logistic regression, hierarchical clustering
        *	Regression or classification:  knn and k-means
