# HW 1 Instructions

1.	Load library MASS.  The first time you use a library you will have to install it but do that at the console, not in your R code. After you load the library, look at the Environment pane in the upper right corner of RStudio. Notice that Boston is listed as <Promise>. When you load the package, R will be aware of the datasets in the package but wonâ€™t waste memory loading them unless you request the data. We want to use the Boston data set so load that into memory with data(Boston).  Use the `str()` function to get an overview of the data. Type `?Boston` at the console (not in your code) and you will see a description of the data set in the lower right hand corner of Rstudio. Write a brief 2-3 sentence description of the data set in the white text portion of your answer for #1.

2.	Use R commands to:
    1.	display the first few rows
    2.	display the last 2 rows
    3.	display row 5
    4.	display the first few rows of column 1 by combining head() and indexing
    5.	display the variable names

3.	Use R statistical functions to find the mean, median, range of the crime column.

4.	Create a histogram of the crime column, with an appropriate main heading. What does the histogram tell you about this variable?

5.	Use the `cor()` function to see if there is a correlation between crime and the median house value. Comment on what this value might mean. How useful might the crime column be for predicting median value?

6.	Create a plot showing the median value on the y axis and number of rooms on the x axis. Create appropriate main, x and y labels, change the point color and style. Reference: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/parameters.html Use the `cor()` function to quantify the correlation between these two variables. Write a sentence summarizing what the graph and correlation tell you about these 2 variables.

7.	Use R functions to determine if variable chas is a factor. Plot median value on the y axis and chas on the x axis. Make chas a factor and plot again. Comment on the difference in meaning of the two graphs. Look back the the description of the Boston data set you got with the `?Boston` command to interpret the meaning of 0 and 1. 

8.	Explore the rad variable. What kind of variable is rad? What information do you get about this variable with the `summary()` function? Does the `unique()` function give you additional information? Use the `sum()` function to determine how many neighborhoods have rad equal to 24. Use R code to determine what percentage this is of the neighborhoods.

9.	Create a new variable called `far` using the `ifelse()` function that is true if rad is 24 and false otherwise. Make the variable a factor. Plot far and medv. What does the graph tell you?

10.	Create a summary of Boston just for columns 1, 6, 13 and 14 (crim, rm, lstat, medv). Use the `which()` function to find the neighborhood with the highest median value. Display that row from the data set, but only colums 1, 6, 13 and 14. Write a few sentences comparing this neighborhood and the city as a whole in terms of: crime, number of rooms, lower economic percent, median value.
