# Project 2 Instructions

*	Select 2 large data sets (minimum: 10K rows). Kaggle is a good source.

* Try at least 3 ML algorithms on each data set, using at least 5 algorithms in all. 
    *	Your R script should include:
        * Link to the source of the data
        *	Code to run the algorithms,
        *	Code to compute your metrics for evaluation
        *	Commentary on the performance of the algorithms

* Prepare a 4-minute presentation (you can just use your Rmd file). The text in your Rmd file and your presentation should indicate for each data set:
    *	Which algorithms you tried with what results
    *	Which algorithm performed best
    *	Comment why the best performing algorithm worked best on that data
    *	What feature selection you tried
    *	What metric(s) you used to evaluate the models
    *	What you learned from the data
